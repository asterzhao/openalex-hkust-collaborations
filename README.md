## About

This project aims to explore how HKUST's researchers are collaborating with people around the globe. It's built based on [the tutorial created by University of Washington (UW)](https://github.com/ourresearch/openalex-api-tutorials/blob/main/notebooks/institutions/uw-collaborators.ipynb). The publication data were obtained through [OpenAlex's API](https://docs.openalex.org/).
